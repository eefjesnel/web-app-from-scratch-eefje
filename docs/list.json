            "experience": "Tanzania was by far one of my favorite holidays! The people are very kind and proud of their country and they love it when you show interest in their work and lives. I started learning a bit of Swahili so I could surprise them by speaking in their own language. The smile that appeared on their faces was more than worth learning the language! I felt very welcome and they even made me feel wanted :)",

            "experience": "Jamaica is a beautiful green and vibrant country, but there is another side of the country most tourist do not inticipate on: the wealth is extremely divited which causes some anger and violence. This is mostly in the capitol, Kingston, which can better be avoided for that very reason. Otherwise Jamaica has a lot to offer; music, culture and beautiful nature. So if you avoid Kingston and focus on the peaceful side of Jamaica, you might just find a paradise you would want to stay forever.",
